This is a personal KK app project for use with my family.

## Start
```
npm start
```

This will start a webpack dev environment running on localhost on port 3000 (it should auto open in the browser). Hot reloading should be working fine so js code changes should be seen in the browser as soon as the code is saved. For css changes you might have to manually refresh the page to see changes.

## Test
```
npm test
```

## Linting (with autofix)
```
npm run lint
```
